# data
how to run the code:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed
2. Open a terminal.
Navigate to the directory containing the InMemoryDB.cpp file.
Compile the code using the following command: g++ -o InMemoryDB InMemoryDB.cpp
Run the executable: ./InMemoryDB

Some suggestions:
Clearer Instructions: Explain exactly what each method should do, especially how transactions should work with the main data.
More Methods: Add functions to manage various data types or perform additional operations like deleting keys or working with complex data.
Better Grading: Create automated tests to check if transactions, error handling, and concurrent access are handled correctly.
Improving Scalability: Discuss ways to make the code faster and use less memory, and possibly include benchmarks for grading.
